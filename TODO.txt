1 - Add a docker-compose.yml at the root to install local supabase environment
2 - Create script for Supabase CLI commands (kind of a "prepare" command)
3 - Create script for deployment-cofigs
4 - How to setup the CMS? It lacks documentation








- Also, here's the full feature list for BLH edition 1 MVP:

Topics should be working. Notes and Social media do not need to be working yet.
Not even highlight. But, make sure these are hidden in UI so it doesn't confuse the user.


Topic Scheduler should be working.

App should be converted to a PWA.

General bug fixing, styling, and app consistency.




- We need to improve upon 3 things:

Make a GitHub Milestone under the issues tab, including all the issues needed for
milestone 1.

Go through app, and figure out if new issues need to be created to fix certain
bugs or styling issues. What's working, what's broken?

Site map would be nice, to easily understand routing.

Make better documentation (can even be all in the README, or a series of markdown files.
You guys can decide). It should include/answer the questions:

   An ERD
   Architecture: tech stack, how the pieces relate. A simple Excalidraw drawing
   may be helpful, along with an explanation.
   Overall explanation of what the app does, and how it works. Specially, what can
   the MVP of the app do, and what features are part of the full featureset.
   A new dev should be able to read the docs and understand how to clone the repo 
   and get it running.


A little explanation that this was made in Winnipeg, with Builder's League
(an ad, basically). Also, a link to OriGatou's linkedin and CBH's Linkedin.

Also, keep in mind that aside from programmers, we have a few people who offered
to make a test plan, and a graphic designer to make a brand guide overhaul later
(not for MVP, Salena said she's happy with current visual style).
