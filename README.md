# Project Overview

The CBH app is a Indigenous education resource platform where users are able to access to truth & reconciliation knoweldge. Also, it works as a social media platform where users can share their thoughts and ideas about resources. It advocates education, inspiration, and interaction.

# Requirements

- Node.js >= 18.17.0
- Docker
- Payload CMS Repo: https://github.com/Builder-s-League/CMS-Payload.git

# Install and Run

1. You'll first need a Supabase project which can be made [via the Supabase dashboard](https://database.new) or running locally using the follow command:

   ```bash
   npx supabase start
   ```

2. Copy and rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and update the following:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT URL]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT API ANON KEY]
   ```

   Both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` can be found in two distinct ways:

   1 - By accessing the Supabase [your Supabase project's API settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api)

   2 - Or on the start command output in step 1 if you use it locally.

   If you prefer to run Supabase locally, you can stop all services using this command:

   ```bash
   npx supabase stop
   ```

3. You can now run the Next.js local development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The starter kit should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

> Check out [the docs for Local Development](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/local-development) to also run Supabase locally.

# Documentation

## Scope

The CBH app is a multi-user platform designed for learning management and collaboration. It supports three user roles with distinct functionalities:

CBH (Service Provider):

- Manages organizations and users, including HR administrators and employees.
- Creates, updates, and deletes (CUD) course content.
- Schedules content delivery and manages user-generated content (e.g., public notes and external content links).
- Collects and reviews user feedback.
- Designs and sends out surveys to employees.

HR (Client Organizations):

- Manages employees (users) within their organization.
- Oversees user-generated content, including public notes and external content links.

Users (Employees of the Client Organization):

- Access course content through the Learning Management System (LMS).
- Create private or public notes linked to specific content.\
- Share external articles on a shared feed.
- Engage with the community feed to view others' public notes and shared content.
- Provide feedback through a dedicated feedback button or respond to surveys sent by CBH.
